Notes for Domain Controller appliance v14.0
===========================================

As of v14.0 TurnKey's domain-controller (DC) appliance 
uses Samba4 to provide a Microsoft Active Directory 
domain.

However, the current v14.0 appliance is a bare-bones 
AD server. It is provided as a "better starting point" 
for those that wish to use Samba4 as an AD DC but is 
far from being feature complete.

Steps that need to be taken when first launched:
------------------------------------------------
- Set a static IP on your domain-controller
    -easiest via confconsole
    -if not using he DHCP assigned IP please re-run the 
     domain provision inithook (copy/paste the following 
     into commandline:

/usr/lib/inithooks/bin/domain-controller.py

- (optional) Create the DNS reverse lookup zone and PTR records.
  example details:
  hostname: dc1  
  domain/realm: domain.lan
  ip address: 192.168.1.50

# Substitute $ADMIN_PASS for the administrator password 
# the 1.168.192 is from the "network IP" (backwards) i.e. this example is for 192.168.1.x
samba-tool dns zonecreate dc1 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa --username=administrator --password="$ADMIN_PASS"

# as above but 50 is from the IP i.e. 192.168.1.50
samba-tool dns add dom-controller 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa 192.168.1.50 PTR dc1.domain.lan --username=administrator --password="$ADMIN_PASS"

- (optional) Adjust DNS forwarder in /etc/samba/smb.conf
    -currently hardcoded to Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
    -edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and adjust the field that 
     is currently "dns forwarder = 8.8.8.8"

For how to join a Windows Desktop to a AD domain see the Samba Wiki: 
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Joining_a_Windows_client_to_a_domain

Features to be added in the future:
-----------------------------------
- Option to provision a fileserver AD member server
    -not yet sure on how this will be implemented...
    -see "Best Practice" notes below

- Support for Roaming Profiles(?)
    -will require AD member fileserver

- Configuration of PTR records for domain controller
    -strictly speaking they're not required but
     would be good

- documentation on including a DHCP server

Backup notes:
-------------
Currently TKLBAM won't properly backup a domain. If you 
wish to use TKLBAM hooks to script it there is info on 
the Samba Wiki:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Backup_and_restore_an_Samba_AD_DC

Note: if you have multiple AD DCs then rather than restore 
from backup; just rejoin the server to the domain. Restoring 
a backup to a server that is already a member of a domain will 
likely cause DB corruption and/or multiple identical domain 
objects.


Best practice recommendations:
------------------------------
General DC Notes
- In production it is recommended that you have a minimum
  of 2 domain controllers in an AD domain. 

File storage/fileserver
- Samba advise against using a (Samba4) domain controller 
  also as a fileserver as well. Instead it is recommended 
  that you create a dedicated fileserver (as a domain member 
  server). The current TurnKey fileserver appliance is 
  NOT useful for this. See notes on the Samba wiki on 
  setting up a member server:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_a_Samba_AD_Member_Server

Further domain configuration e.g. DNS, 
- Samba recommend using Microsoft tools (from within a
  Windows workstation) to do additional AD (Samba4) 
  configuration.

Realm/TLD
- For production usage it is recommended to use a 
  domain name that you have registered with a domain 
  registrar. If you plan to use a domain that you already 
  own (e.g. "example.com") as your realm then add a 
  unique subdomain to avoid potential problems (e.g. 
  "ad.example.com")
- Do not use ".local" realms/tlds as they can conflict 
  with Apple (bonjour) and zeroconf type networked devices.
