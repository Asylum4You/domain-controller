Notes for Domain Controller appliance v14.0
===========================================

As of v14.0 TurnKey's domain-controller (DC) appliance 
uses Samba4 to provide a Microsoft Active Directory 
domain.

However, the current v14.0 appliance is a bare-bones 
AD server. It is provided as a "better starting point" 
for those that wish to use Samba4 as an AD DC but is 
far from being feature complete.

Steps that need to be taken when first launched:
------------------------------------------------
- Set a static IP on your domain-controller
    -easiest via confconsole
    -if not the DHCP assigned IP please re-run the domain 
     provision inithook (copy/paste the following into 
     commandline:

/usr/lib/inithooks/bin/domain-controller

- (optional) Create the DNS zone and PTR records.
  example details"
  domain

- (optional) Adjust DNS forwarder in /etc/samba/smb.conf
    -currently hardcoded to Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
    -edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and adjust the field that 
     is currently "dns forwarder = 8.8.8.8"

Features to be added in the future:
-----------------------------------
- Option to provision a fileserver AD member server
    -not yet sure on how this will be implemented...
    -see "Best Practice" notes below

- Support for Roaming Profiles(?)
    -will require AD member fileserver

- Configuration of PTR records for domain controller
    -strictly speaking they're not required but
     would be good

- documentation on including a DHCP server

Backup notes:
-------------
Currently TKLBAM won't properly backup a domain. If you 
wish to use TKLBAM hooks to script it there is info on 
the Samba Wiki:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Backup_and_restore_an_Samba_AD_DC

Note: if you have multiple AD DCs then rather than restore 
from backup; just rejoin the server to the domain. Restoring 
a backup to a server already a member of a domain will likely 
cause DB corruption and/or multiple iddentical domain objects.

As noted about 

Best practice recommendations:
------------------------------
General DC Notes
- In production it is recommended that you have a mimimum
  of 2 domain controllers in an AD domain. 

File storage/fileserver
- Samba advise against using a (Samba4) domain controller 
  also as a fileserver as well. Instead it is recommended 
  that you create a dedicated fileserver (as a domain member 
  server). The current TurnKey fileserver appliance is 
  NOT currently useful for this. See notes on Samba wiki:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_a_Samba_AD_Member_Server

Further domain configuration e.g. DNS, 
- Samba recommend using Microsoft tools (from within a
  Windows workstation) to do additional AD (Samba4) 
  configuration.

Realm/TLD
- For production usage it is recommended to use a 
  domain name that you have registered with a domain 
  registrar. If you plan to use a domain that you already 
  own (e.g. "example.com") as your realm then add a 
  unique subdomain to avoid potential problems (e.g. 
  "ad.example.com")
  Do not use ".local" realms/tlds as they can conflict 
  with Apple (bonjour) and zeroconf type networked devices.
